      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest to me, is the way in which immigrant foods, like Christmas cookies have changed to adapt to American tastes/American kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent considerable time baking heirloom family cookie recipes in the kitchen at Christmas with my family. I thought it would be interesting to compare my family recipes with how they now exist in modern Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My great aunt Alice was often considered the &amp;ldquo;master of these recipes&amp;rdquo; and helped translate some of them from German at sometime. My hope is that I can accurately provide the recipes as Alice brought them to us, but also compare them to their German counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
