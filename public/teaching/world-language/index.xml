&lt;p&gt;This spring my goal has been to dive head first into creating content for my German classroom. However my biggest concern in doing so was ensuring that my labor was being utilized to create works that could benefit students and teachers outside of my classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating WL resources are particularly time intensive, and the “time-payoff” (hours spent using in the classroom / hours spent creating) is often out of sync. I want the work I do to incentivize others to share resources and collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
