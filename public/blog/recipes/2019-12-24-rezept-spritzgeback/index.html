          2 1/2 cups (300g) Flour   1/2 tsp Salt   1 Cup (225g) Butter   3/4 Cup (150g) Sugar   1 Egg (or 3 Yolks)   3/4 tsp Almond Extract
          500g (4.2 cups) Flour   1 pinch of Salt   250g (1.1 cups) Butter   250g (1.2 cups) Sugar   3 egg yolks (medium)   2 packets of Vanilla Sugar   Lemon or Orange Zest   2 tsp backing powder   1 tbsp Milk
      
      
          Cream butter and sugar. Add egg, almond extract, flour and salt gradually. Press a small amount of dough through cookie press onto baking sheet.      Bake 400F in a conventional oven or 375F for convection for 6 to 8 Minutes.      Watch carefully that they don&rsquo;t turn too brown.      &ldquo;Always use butter and I often double the recipe. This has always been one of our favorite holiday cookies&rdquo; - Alice Beckman
          Preaheat the oven to 350 for conventional or 320 for convection.      Stir butter or margarine smoothly in a mixing bowl with a mixer (mixing attachments) at the highest setting. Gradually stir in the sugar, vanilla sugar, egg yolk, salt and lemon zest. Stir until the sugar has dissolved and a bound mass is formed. Mix the flour with the baking powder and stir in 2/3 of it alternately with the milk at medium speed. Knead in the remaining flour on the work surface.      Press the dough in small portions through a meat grinder with a special attachment, cut into pieces of any length and place on the baking sheet. Bake.      Pastries must still be light colored, do not over brown.      Insert: middle rack   Baking time: about 11 minutes
