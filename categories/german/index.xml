(Attempt 1)
One of things that I miss the most about living in Germany is the incredible variety of breads that just aren&amp;rsquo;t available in the United States.
During Covid-19, I&amp;rsquo;ve been making weekly loaves of Jim Lahey&amp;rsquo;s No Knead bread, and thought my next bread should be one that I am unable to find in the United States.
After doing a little hunting on the internet I stumbled across Pl√∂tzblog: an incredible bread baking site with many of the German bread recipes I missed with recipes to bake at home.</description></item><item><title>Auf dem Weg!
