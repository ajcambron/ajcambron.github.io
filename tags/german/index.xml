Having spent considerable time baking heirloom family cookie recipes in the kitchen at Christmas with my family. I thought it would be interesting to compare my family recipes with how they now exist in modern Germany.
My great aunt Alice was often considered the &amp;ldquo;master of these recipes&amp;rdquo; and helped translate some of them from German at sometime.</description></item></channel></rss>
