## Ingredients

- 2 cups of finely ground Cauliflower Rice (from one head of Cauliflower)
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup cheddar or mozzarella cheese
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon basil
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/8 teaspoon red chili powder
- 2 tablespoon almond flour
- 1 egg


## Method
Place a pizza stone in the oven. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

On a cutting board, prepare a piece of parchment paper and spray it with avocado oil.

### Make the Cauli-flour

Dice cauliflower to a relatively small size so that it will blend properly. 
Pulse in a blender until you get fine rice. 
You should end up with 2 to 3 cups cauliflower rice (finely ground). 
Microwave the rice for 4-6 minutes. Transfer heated cauliflower onto a clean tea towel. 
Let cool.

Once cauliflower is cool, remove as much water is possible by wringing the cloth. 
The drier the better. You can also wring the tea towel and set on some paper towels to help get out the last drops.

### Make Crust

Mix Dry Ingredients. 
Add Egg to Dry Mixture. 
Stir with spatula. 
Kneed until dough is well mixed closer to the consistency of tortilla masa. 
If it is crumbly, consider adding more egg to make the mixture bond better. 
Form the dough into a ball, and place on greased parchment. 
Press dough out to desired pizza dough thickness.

Using a peel, slide the parchment paper onto your hot pizza stone. Bake for 7 minutes or until golden brown.

From here, top your Pizza as usual (slightly less cheese than usual seems like a good move and bake until cheese is crispy. (5 minutes or so)
