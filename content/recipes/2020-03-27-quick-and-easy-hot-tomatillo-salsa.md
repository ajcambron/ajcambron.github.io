My attempt at making a tomatillo salsa with easily acquirable ingredients that is a consistent favorite!




## Ingredients

16 Tomatillos - remove skins and rinse  
5 Cloves Garlic  
1 Jalapeño  
5-6 dried red chilies or a spoonful of red chili powder (I actually like Indian red chili powder best, NOT chili powder from the grocery store, which includes additional spices)  
Salt  
spoonful of cumin  
juice from 1/2 lime

## Instructions

1. Broil tomatillos, cloves, jalapeño for 6 minutes a side (12 minutes total) near the heating element. Exterior should be charred.
2. Combine all ingredients into a blender. Blend on a low setting, taste and adjust ingredients as necessary. Much of this is dependent on the size of the vegetables you have access to.
3. Transfer to an airtight container, should last at least a week or so in the fridge.
