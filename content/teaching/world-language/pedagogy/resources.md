## Intro
This spring my goal has been to dive head first into creating content for my German classroom. However my biggest concern in doing so was ensuring that my labor was being utilized to create works that could benefit students and teachers outside of my classroom.

Creating WL resources are particularly time intensive, and the “time-payoff” (hours spent using in the classroom / hours spent creating) is often out of sync. I want the work I do to incentivize others to share resources and collaborate.

I also want to help give teachers the structural supports they need to get started in creating their own materials.

## Creating Activities from Openly Licensed Resources

The simplest (from a legal perspective) way of creating new OER is to create educational resources from already openly licensed materials.

- A good bank to draw on initially is this portal from the CC: https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/education-oer/education-oer-resources/

- For creating materials that draw from current events/new sources: https://de.wikinews.org/wiki/Hauptseite (Other languages available)

- For text excerpts from works already in the public domain https://www.gutenberg.org/

## My opinion on licensing

Having spoken to other CC educators about the topic, I feel that the best practice is to license as much work as possible under CC-BY, at least until we reach a point where the “core” of an open curriculum is firmly established.

From a creator standpoint, it is important to note that this means that all works created may only share and adapt works licensed under:

    CC-BY
    CC-0*
    Public Domain

*Additional licenses like those found on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/service/license/), that do not require attribution or limit the way in which the work can be distributed.

Best practice in all uses is to attribute the adapted or shared works using the guidelines presented here on the Creative Commons wiki: https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/best_practices_for_attribution
