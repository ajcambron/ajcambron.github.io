From the Delaware Pathways Site

“The Digital Communication Technology (DCT) pathway requires students to apply the skills and tools of digital designers used in graphic design, pixel-based imagery manipulation, HTML coding, digital video production, vector image manipulation, digital illustration, and digital publishing. Students utilize strategies to solve open-ended problems while learning how to apply technical skills, creative skills, industry knowledge, documentation techniques, and processes using modern, industry-leading technology and software.

Client-based learning experiences and industry-mentored projects introduce students to a wide array of related careers in public relations, marketing, web and digital communications and printing.”
