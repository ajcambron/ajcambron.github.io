# Hello, I'm Andrew Cambron.

I am an **Educator/Filmmaker** based in Newark, DE. I have been working on the documentary *Driven* with my collaborator Dr. Georgina Ramsay.

I currently teach at **Newark High School**, guiding students through a multi-disciplinary course focused on producing digital media.

My career journey began in the **Los Angeles film industry**, where I gained wide-ranging experience across commercials, short films, and VR projects. 

My driving passion is **developing open educational resources** to improve access to cost-free teaching materials and enhance educational outcomes for all students.
