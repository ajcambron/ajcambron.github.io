# Hello, I'm Andrew Cambron.

I am an Educator/Filmmaker based in Newark, DE. I have been working on the documentary *Driven* with my partner/collaborator Dr. Georgina Ramsay

I currently teach at Newark High School, guiding students through a multi-disciplinary course focused on producing digital media.

My career journey began in the **Los Angeles film industry**, where I gained wide-ranging experience across commercials, short films, and VR projects. 

I have worn many hats, and while teaching German, I was named Indiana's **Rising Star German Teacher of the Year** in 2019.

My driving passion is **developing open educational resources** to improve access to cost-free teaching materials and enhance educational outcomes for all students.
