One of my favorite parts of enjoying a German Biergarten in the summer is the onion covered cheese spread that goes on a crusty Bavarian pretzel.

Here is my recipe for Obazda, using readily available ingredients in the USA

#### Ingredients

- 250g Camembert (let ripen! the stinkier the better!)  
- 20g (2 tbsp) Butter  
- 100g (half a package) Philadelphia cream cheese (Frischk√§se if available)  
- 50g (half a small onion) finely chopped onion (cut in half to create rings)  
- 1 tsp Caroway seed (or more to taste)  
- 1/4 cup of beer. Preferably a German lager (Spaten, Hacker Pschorr, or Augustiner if you are so lucky)  
- Paprika (mixed in until you get the desireable orange color and flavor)  
- Salt and Pepper  
  
*Garnish with chives and onion, cut into rings.*

#### Directions

1. Mix the butter and cheeses together with the back of a spoon.  
2. Next add onion, Caroway and beers, stirring after each addition
3. Continue to season with Caroway, Paprika, salt and pepper until you get the desired flavor.
4. Add your chives and onion, and plate with a crusty pretzel or fresh bread.
